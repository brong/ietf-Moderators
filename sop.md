# Moderators Standard Operating Procedures

## Personnel

The Moderators team can be reached at saa@ietf.org.

## General operations

The Moderators strive to monitor all postings on ietf@ietf.org on a daily basis. The IETF Chair also monitors the list but may not be in a position to read each message or monitor every day.

When IETF discussion list subscribers believe that a posting may be considered inappropriate according to [RFC XXXX] or the [Uncivil Commentary Description], they are encouraged to report it to saa@ietf.org. Moderators team members are also subscribers to the IETF discussion list and they follow the same process to report posts that they consider inappropriate.The Moderators team will discuss all reports received and make a determination about whether they believe the posting was inappropriate. At least two team members must agree that a posting was inappropriate before the Moderators team takes any action in response.

When the Moderators team determines that a posting is inappropriate, one team member suggests a response to the rest of the team, including specific text for email(s) to the original poster and/or the list, as appropriate. The Moderators team uses a standard set of [email templates]. Proposed emails to either individuals or to the list must be vetted and approved by at least one other Moderators team member before being sent.


## Escalation ladder for handling Uncivil commentary and disruptive behavior

The Moderators team uses the escalation ladder below for handling disruptive behavior and postings containing uncivil commentary. At each step, the Moderators team describes to the individual poster what the next step in the ladder is.

### Level 0: Initial suggestion

A Moderators team member sends an off-list message to the individual on behalf of the Moderators team. This message clearly identifies the concern, offers assistance with re-framing language, and identifies consequences for continued inappropriate postings.

### Level 1: Cooling off period

A Moderators team member sends an off-list message to the individual on behalf of the Moderators team. This message clearly identifies the concern, offers assistance with re-framing language, and identifies consequences for continued inappropriate postings. 

The Moderators team member also requests that the individual take a voluntary 5-day "cooling off" period during which time the individual does not send email to ietf@ietf.org. The Moderators team member informs the individual that a note will be sent to ietf@ietf.org to inform the list that the Moderator is engaging with the individual. The Moderators team member sends that note to ietf@ietf.org shortly thereafter.

### Level 2: Temporary posting rights restriction

A Moderators team member sends an off-list message to the individual on behalf of the Moderators team. This message clearly identifies the concern and the pattern of abuse, and offers assistance with re-framing language.

Subject to the approval by the IETF Chair, the Moderators team member also informs the individual that his or her posting rights to ietf@ietf.org will be restricted for 14 days. The Moderators team member informs the individual that a note will be sent to ietf@ietf.org to inform the list that the Moderators has restricted their posting rights. The Moderators team member sends that note to ietf@ietf.org shortly thereafter.

### Immediate escalation in egregious cases

In cases where postings contain egregious language, the Moderators team has the discretion to skip level 0 and go straight to level 1 or 2. For example, a posting that says "I'm coming to murder you and your family" would warrant an immediate escalation to level 2.

## Finding a more specific forum

RFC XXXX explains that:

"The IETF discussion list is meant for discussions for which a more appropriate list does not exist, such as discussions that do not fall within the scope of any working group, area, or other established list.  When discussions are started on the IETF discussion list for which such a venue does exist, they should be continued at that other venue as soon as this is pointed out."

The Moderators team will make suggestions to the list in cases where discussions should be moved to more specific forum(s) along with a pointer to the more specific forum(s). 

## Announcements

RFC XXXX considers:

"Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are not sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or the IETF." 

The Moderators team will make an initial suggestion to the individual off-list (as well as send a reminder on the list) to avoid such postings. If a pattern of abuse emerges, we will consider temporarily restricting the posting rights to ietf@ietf.org.
