# Sergeant-at-Arms Standard Operating Procedures

## Personnel

The sergeant-at-arms (SAA) team consists of the sergeants-at-arms and the IETF Chair. They can all be reached at saa@ietf.org, which has a private archive accessible only to the SAA team.

## General operations

The sergeants-at-arms strive to monitor all postings on ietf@ietf.org on a daily basis. The IETF Chair also monitors the list but may not be in a position to read each message or monitor every day.

When a member of the SAA team sees a list posting that may be considered inappropriate according to [RFC 3005] and the [Unprofessional Commentary Description], the team member reports it to saa@ietf.org. Subscribers to ietf@ietf.org are also encouraged to report postings they believe to be inappropriate under those guidelines to saa@ietf.org. 

A report made by a member of the SAA team should include a suggested action in response, including specific text for email(s) to the original poster and/or the list, as appropriate. The SAA team uses a standard set of [email templates].

## Escalation ladder

The SAA team uses the escalation ladder below. At each step, the SAA team describes to the individual poster what the next step in the ladder is.

### Level 0: Friendly suggestion

An SAA team member sends an off-list message to the individual on behalf of the SAA team, with saa@ietf.org on cc. This message clearly identifies the concern, offers assistance with re-framing language, and identifies consequences for continued inappropriate postings.

### Level 1: Cooling off period

An SAA team member sends an off-list message to the individual on behalf of the SAA team, with saa@ietf.org on cc. This message clearly identifies the concern, offers assistance with re-framing language, and identifies consequences for continued inappropriate postings. 

The SAA team member also requests that the individual take a voluntary 5-day "cooling off" period during which time the individual does not send email to ietf@ietf.org. The SAA team member informs the individual that a note will be sent to ietf@ietf.org to inform the list that the SAA is engaging with the individual.

### Level 2: Temporary posting rights restriction

An SAA team member sends an off-list message to the individual on behalf of the SAA team, with saa@ietf.org on cc. This message clearly identifies the concern and offers assistance with re-framing language.

The SAA team member also informs the individual that his or her posting rights to ietf@ietf.org will be restricted for 14 days. The SAA team member informs the individual that a note will be sent to ietf@ietf.org to inform the list that the SAA is engaging with the individual.


## Engagement

Be **explicit** and **specific** and **empathetic**

Before starting an engagement, inform and/or vet initial communications with the rest of SAA.

* **Explicit**
  * For the initial contact, why the SAA is reaching out
  * Set expectations for this engagement
    * State correspondence will be including/forwarding to [saa@ietf.org][SAA-ML]
    * State the desired outcomes from the engagement
    * State what the actions the SAA is taking (e.g., "request that you ... in furture messagts") and **is not** taking (e.g., "no PR restrictions")
    * State how the SAA will escalate from here
    * State that the [OMBUDSTEAM] is being consulted, if warranted
* **Specific**
  * What the content that triggered the engagement
  * Why that content is problematic/concerning
  * If determined to be the latest in chronic behavior, include references from [public archives][IETF-ARC] to present/establish the pattern
* **Empathic**
  * Remember "we are all human beings" -- the actor, the target, and possibly the subject
  * For a single incident, approach from the assumption of "good faith"
