Hi [NAME],

I am writing to you on behalf of the sergeant-at-arms (SAA) team for ietf@ietf.org. This message has been vetted with others on the SAA team, which is described in more detail at [1].

We are reaching out to you because of your recent message to ietf@ietf.org [2]. The message contained the following language:

[LANGUAGE]

which the SAA team considers unprofessional commentary [3] for [REASON]. Please try to avoid using this kind of language on ietf@ietf.org in the future. We are happy to discuss suggestions for how to convey the same message in an appropriate way if you would like to discuss that.

We consider this an initial suggestion. We do not believe your message is part of a pattern of abuse that would warrant the restriction of your posting rights. If we see such a pattern emerge, we will get back in touch with you to suggest that you voluntarily take a break from posting to the list.

If you wish for us to make this message public, please let us know and we will re-send it with ietf@ietf.org on cc.

Thanks,
