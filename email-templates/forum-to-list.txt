Hi all,

We wanted to let the list know that the Moderators team (described in more detail at [1]) consider this thread [2] to be more appropriate for this [FORUM][3]. And as per the IETF discussion list charter [4], we suggest that the discussions should be moved to the more specific forum identified. 

[The Moderators team has been in touch with the [FORUM] administers off-list.] (if required)

Thanks,
[NAME] on behalf of the Moderators team
