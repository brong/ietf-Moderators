Hi all,

We wanted to let the list know that the Moderators team (described in more detail at [1]) has determined that [NAME] has engaged in a pattern of abuse based on their recent messages to this list [2][3] under a new subject line but on the same topic against the direction from the IETF chair to bar posting on the thread [4]. Their posting rights to the ietf@ietf.org mailing list have been restricted for the next 14 days.  We encourage everyone to review the IETF discussion list charter [5] and our SOP [6]. 

Thanks,
[NAME] on behalf of the SAA team
