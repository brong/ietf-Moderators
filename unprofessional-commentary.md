# Unprofessional commentary

RFC 3005 states that inappropriate postings to ietf@ietf.org include:

* Unsolicited bulk e-mail
* Discussion of subjects unrelated to IETF policy, meetings,
      activities, or technical concerns
* Unprofessional commentary, regardless of the general subject
* Announcements of conferences, events, or activities that are not
      sponsored or endorsed by the Internet Society or IETF.
      
"Unprofessional commentary" is not further described in RFC 3005. In some ways, it is an unfortunate term because the IETF is not considered by all to be a professional organization, and norms concerning professionalism can vary widely based on culture and context. But it is the term we have for now. For ietf@ietf.org to be a more functional list, the term requires further description, which is what this document seeks to do.

Judgments about what is considered unprofessional commentary will necessarily always be subjective. The boundary between appropriate and inappropriate list conduct will never be a bright line. Human behavior and communication does not lend itself to the same precision that protocol engineering does.

The current sergeant-at-arms team considers the following types of language to be unprofessional commentary:

**Threats of violence**

This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm.

**Personal attacks**

Personal attacks include attacking people for their opinions, beliefs, or ideas rather than criticizing the opinions, beliefs, and ideas themselves. Personal attacks also include name-calling and insulting, demeaning, or belittling others. 

**Derogatory language**

Hurtful language related to the race, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, marital status, religion, ethnicity, national origin, or ancestry of other participants.
