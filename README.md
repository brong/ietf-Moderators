# IETF Sergeant-at-Arms

A repository of guidelines, procedures, and templates used by the sergeant-at-arms (SAA).

While [RFC 3005] creates the role sergeant-at-arms to act as a moderator for the ietf@ietf.org mailing list, the guidance for inappropriate postings and the actions to be taken are not well-defined.  This repository aims to address this lack of clarity.

* [Standard Operating Procedures](sop.md) outlines how and when the SAA engages to inappropriate postings, including escalation paths.
* [Email templates](email\ templates) that engagement messages from the SAA follow.
* [unprofessional-commentary.md] defines what is considered unprofessional for the ietf@ietf.org mailing list.

This set of documents is considered a work-in-progress, and is expected to evolve to meet the needs of the IETF.

## Note

The content of this repository was influenced by the [Contributor Covenant], the [Django Code of Conduct], the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines] and [How to Respond to Code of Conduct Reports].
